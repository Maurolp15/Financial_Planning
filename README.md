## Financial Planning

My name is Oscar Lopez, I’m a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp Program. 

In this activity I was task with developing a prototype application to create a tool that helps a credit union’s members enhance their financial health. The credit union is requesting to forecast a retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks and bonds. I will be using the skills learned in the class until now focusing in APIs as part of the technical solution to create two financial analyses: 

A personal finance plan to visualize their savings to evaluate if they have enough money for an emergency fund

A retirement plan tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project future portfolio performance

In this assignment, I had challenges setting up API keys correctly and memorizing all the different functions and attributes on Alpaca and Monte Carlo simulations, however, going back to class videos and  exercises, I was able to complete the task.
